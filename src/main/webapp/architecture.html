        <h2>Constructed in the traditional Nagara style, the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir has a length 
            (east-west) of 380 feet, a width of 250 feet, and a height of 161 feet. 
            Supported by a total of 392 pillars and 44 doors, the Mandir is three-storied, with 
            each floor being 20 feet tall.</h2>

        <h2>
            The Ayodhya Ram Mandir is a grand temple built in the Nagara style of temple architecture, 
            characterized by its towering spires or shikharas. The temple is built using pink sandstone 
            and is spread across an area of 2.77 acres. The temple is surrounded by a large courtyard 
            and has several smaller shrines dedicated to other Hindu deities. The most striking feature 
            of the temple is the giant Shaligram stone, a black stone believed to represent Lord Ram and 
            brought from the Gandaki river in Nepal.</h2>

            <h2>The temple is 161 feet high and has three floors, each with a different purpose. The first 
            floor is dedicated to Lord Ram, while the second floor is dedicated to Lord Hanuman, and the 
            third floor is a museum showcasing the history and culture of Ayodhya.</h2>
            
            <h2>The temple complex also includes a yajnashala or a hall for conducting yajnas or Hindu fire 
            rituals, a community kitchen, and a medical facility. The temple complex is spread over 67 acres 
            and is expected to become a major cultural and religious center, attracting millions of devotees 
            from around the world.</h2>

                The total length of this wall is 732 metres and its width is 14 feet.</h2>
            <h2>A 14-metre thick layer of roller-compacted concrete, looking like an artificial rock, 
                has been used to construct the foundation of the temple.  A 21-foot-high plinth of Granite 
                has been constructed for protection against ground moisture.</h2>

                <h2>Along with the main Ram Mandir, the temple complex consists of several other 
                    religious structures:  One temple has been built at each of the four corners 
                    of the compound. These temples are dedicated to Surya Dev, Devi Bhagwati, 
                    Ganesh Bhagwan, and Lord Shiva. The northern arm of the temple complex consists
                    of a temple of Maa Annapurna and in the southern arm, there is a temple of Lord Hanuman.
                    A historic well called Sita Koop is located near the temple. This dates back to the 
                    ancient era.  Some other temples proposed to be constructed within the temple complex 
                    are those dedicated to Maharishi Vashishtha, Maharishi Valmiki, Maharishi Vishwamitra, 
                    Maharishi Agastya, Nishad Raj, Devi Ahilya, and Mata Shabri.  Kuber Tila is located 
                    in the southwestern part of the complex. The ancient temple of Lord Shiva located in 
                    this part has been restored. Also, a bronze idol of the Ramayana character ‘Jatayu’ 
                    has been installed here.
